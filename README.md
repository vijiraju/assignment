In the given data set i was asked to predict only 10 breeds of dogs. So only 841 images were available for 10 breeds which is also impossible for model to predict correctly . so i have added almost 10 filters using Pillow library namely 
1)Detail
2)Edge enhance
3)Smooth
4)Sharpen
5)Edge enhance more 
6)Left flip
7)Rotation90
8)Bright
9)Dark
10)Smoothmore
,then i have converted 841 images to 8410 images
then among those 7414 images were used for training and 1847 images were used for test which are available in the folders "link for train images " and "link for test images".
because of technical issue my card is not accepting for hosting . so pls watch the video file i have uploaded in this repository.
